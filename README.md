# Update Website and Database

The website is implemented using the following technologies:
- Front-end: `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Jinja2`
- Back-end: `Flask`
- Database: `SQLite`

What I do:
- Using sqlite3 to connect to the database and update it
- Implement the “Price Statistics” page
- Make it possible for staff to add new tracks to the database through website
